## About
~ 2 months before every internship season, every single CS student in the world has felt the pain of the sinking realization that they don't know how to do competitive coding. Luckily, LeetCode Premium is one of the best resources for practicing questions and attempting mock interviews. Unfortunately, it is also *obscenely* expensive unless you have an extra kidney at home.

So, we built an app that allows you to discover other BITSians willing to share a LeetCode premium subscription.

 Now you don't need to stress about **Leetcode**, you can just take ***Lite*-code**. ~~sorry dush-t pls dont kick me from acm~~

## Usage
Just create an account using your BITS email address, and view all the open rooms! Once you find a room with some of your friends, you can join the room. In case your friends haven't signed up yet, you can create a room and give them the room name!

Once the room gets filled with 4 people, the admin locks the room and will create a WhatsApp group with the members. From there, it's upto you to make the payment and start coding!

## For Developers and Hackermanz
This app was made with <3 by students from BITS Pilani, using `React.js` for the frontend and `Node.js` for the backend. It uses the *Chakra-UI* library, *Google O-Auth*, and *Docker+Nginx* for hosting.  

In case you'd like to run this on your local machine, follow these steps:

**Clone the repository**  
```git clone https://github.com/bitsacm/litecode.git```

**Build the client**  
```cd client```
