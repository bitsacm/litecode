**collaborative leetcode account sharing**

## Instructions
1. @frontend peeps branch off on the client branch (git checkout client), only work in the client folder
2. @backend peeps branch off on the server branch (git checkout server), only work in the server folder

this way we won't end up having to unneccesary keep up with the other peeps code
